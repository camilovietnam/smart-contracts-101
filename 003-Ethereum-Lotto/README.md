# Lottery project
This is a very basic, sort of "Hello World" project for smart contracts. It's a lottery where people can send money, and then the original owner of the contract can activate a function that chooses a winner randomly from those who joined the lottery round.

# Used technologies
- Solidity for the Smart Contract
- React for the Front End
- NPM for package management 

# How to use
Navigate to the `react-app` folder, and run `npm install` followed by `npm run start`. Then, go to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the main page of the lottery:

The page will show a form where you can introduce your bet. It will also have two other pages, one for all the players in the current round (http://localhost:3000/players) and one for the winners of previous rounds (http://localhost:3000/winners). 

Here is a short video showing the basic use of the lottery:
