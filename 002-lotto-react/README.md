# React Lottery app

This app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to use

In the project directory, you can run `npm run start`. 
This will start the HTTP server and serve the app on address [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Important!

You need to copy the EBI and address of the contract that you get from the code in folder `001 ...`, after running the `node deploy.js` code, into the `src/loadContract.js` file. The committed information represents the contract I used during development, and might no longer be available, or might even be incorrect at the time you clone the repository.
